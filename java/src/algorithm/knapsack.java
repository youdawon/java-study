/**
 * Hereâ€™s an overview and example problem for the **0/1 Knapsack Problem**:
 *
 * ### Problem Statement:
 * Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item
 * to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit
 * and the total value is as large as possible. Unlike the fractional knapsack problem,
 * in the **0/1 Knapsack Problem**, you cannot take a fraction of an item.
 * You either take the whole item or leave it.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *
 * - **Input**:
 *   - `n = 3` (number of items)
 *   - `W = 50` (maximum weight capacity)
 *   - `weights[] = {10, 20, 30}`
 *   - `values[] = {60, 100, 120}`
 *
 * - **Output**:
 *   - Maximum value that can be obtained: 220
 *
 * ### Explanation:
 * You can take items 2 and 3, which weigh 20 + 30 = 50 and have a value of 100 + 120 = 220.
